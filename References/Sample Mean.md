## Sample Mean

### What is Sample Mean?
Sample Mean is when we take a random sample from the entire population and calculate the mean for the randomly selected sample. 

### Calculating the Sample Mean

In order to calculate the sample mean, we take a arbitrary number of samples from the population and then calculate the mean. 

```
Sample mean = x = ( Î£ xi ) / n
```
where

    xi is a list of randomly selected elements from the population

    n is the sample size of the elements in the new list
